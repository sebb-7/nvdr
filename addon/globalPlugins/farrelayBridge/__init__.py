"""farrelayBridge — drive the farrelay master client from inside NVDA.

The plugin spawns `farrelay --ipc` as a subprocess **on demand** — it does not
connect at NVDA startup. The first NVDA+F11 press starts the subprocess and
dials the relay; once `state ready` arrives, subsequent NVDA+F11 presses
toggle passthrough. While passthrough is on the plugin reads the subprocess's
speech events back into local speech and intercepts every keystroke,
forwarding it as a raw VK transition.

Why a subprocess and not a direct TLS client in Python: the farrelay binary
already does TLS pinning, protocol-v2 framing, version-mismatch handling,
held-key tracking, and reconnect/backoff. Reusing it via IPC keeps that logic
in one place (Rust, tested) and keeps this add-on a thin shim.
